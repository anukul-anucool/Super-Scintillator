# Super-Scintillator
FOR PREDICTION :
Basically our idea is to predict and prevent the natural disasters at some places where there are frequent natural disasters.
consider a place which experiences frequent earthquakes.Take the statistical data of the richter scale at times of earthquakes.
create the richter scaleand check the readings.
we alarm the people to evacuate the place if the reading of richter scale is about to aproach the previous readings.
the idea of comparing previous richter scale values can also be used to predict tsunamis since tsunamis are consequences of earthquakes
in sea bed
another major disaster now a days is storm
we check the speed of air and the rainfall at places frequently attacked by storms
as the readings approaches the previous values we alram the people to evacuate
FOR PREVENTION:
we will make website in which there is a blog for marking people who are safe which is to be done by themselves to mark themselves safe
another blog for people who wants to donate some money that will be collected in an account and ultimately sent to some government or organisation who are working regarding this
we can also give an option on the page that if someone is still trapped and want some special help they can drop a request
